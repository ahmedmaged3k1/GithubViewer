   - Utilizes Dagger Hilt for efficient dependency injection, enhancing modularity and scalability.
   - Provides a testable and maintainable architecture.

3. **Jetpack Compose:**
   - Utilizes Jetpack Compose, a modern Android UI toolkit, for building dynamic and responsive native UIs.
   - Employs a declarative syntax, simplifying UI development.

4. **Unit Testing:**
   - Implements extensive unit testing to ensure the correctness of ViewModel logic.
   - Utilizes Dagger Hilt's testing support for efficient dependency injection during unit tests.
   - Leverages Jetpack Compose testing utilities for UI component testing.

5. **GitHub API Integration with Retrofit:**
   - Seamless integration with Retrofit for fetching repository data from the GitHub API.
   - Implements custom endpoints for retrieving repositories and details.

6. **Room Database Caching:**
   - Utilizes Room Database for local caching of fetched repository data.
   - Implements functions for inserting, updating, and retrieving repositories from the local database.

   - Leverages Coroutines for efficient handling of asynchronous operations.
   - Enhances app responsiveness and overall performance.

8. **Pagination-Like Behavior:**
   - Incorporates pagination-like behavior in the main screen for loading more repositories as the user scrolls.
   - Ensures a smooth user experience while exploring a large number of repositories.

9. **Error Handling:**
   - Implements robust error handling mechanisms.
   - Provides appropriate UI feedback for scenarios such as network errors or empty responses.
